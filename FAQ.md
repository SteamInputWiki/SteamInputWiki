# Frequently Asked Questions

The following are frequently asked questions that tend to appear on different places on the web and various Steam Controller related communities.

We will do our best to give a short form answer while still giving it the complexity it deserves for those that may not want to read the entire Wiki.

Many of these questions may not actively be answered anywhere else in the wiki and may not indicate a desire from the team to be expanded upon in such a way. Some of these are simply Q&A.


## Question: Why does my controller show up as an Xbox controller in game? How do I fix this?

**Answer:** Steam currently only supports XInput as its legacy API system, therefore Steam Input will only ever be able to present your controller as an Xbox controller. 

You do have the option to disable Steam Input support on a per game basis however please be cognizant of the fact that support for PlayStation and Switch controllers is very much lacking on PC.

You may find that many of the games that you want to play outright don't support your controller without Steam Input.


## Question: What is this weird noise? Is my controller broken?

**Answer:** Probably not, don't worry. The Steam Controller features haptic feedback technology, haptics in and of themselves being fairly loud in comparison to traditional rumble motors.

If you would like it can be disabled either on a configuration basis, or all together in the controller settings. Click here to learn more.

## Question: My steam controller dongle is broken / lost. Is my controller now soft bricked?

**Answer:** No, there are two options; the steam controller can be used with any micro USB cable or alternatively controllers that have been updated to the latest firmware will now have support for Bluetooth LE.

If your controller is not currently running the newest firmware plugging it in through micro USB to a computer using the latest version of Steam should automatically prompt you to update your firmware.

Once the firmware is updated most decent quality Bluetooth receivers should be able to be used instead of the original 2.4 Ghz dongle.

See the following article for pairing information and more.


## Question: How can I use my Steam Controller with Android? When I go to *(insert game here)* the Steam Controller only shows up as a mouse and keyboard.

**Answer:** The Steam Controller's rudimentary support for Android was only ever intended for the Steam Link app. While newer builds of Android we're supposed to include native support many of the community have found this to be very hit or miss, and mapping the Steam Controller as keyboard and mouse may work but is also very hit or miss.

The only application that is guaranteed to work correctly is still the Steam Link app for Android.


## Question: Can I play (insert game here) on a controller?

Answer: most likely, yes. Steam input supports the common input types that your game is likely to expect. 

Some games may not necessarily work without very specific peripherals, in this case scenario however no controller or mouse and keyboard would function.

If you're having problems getting your game set up please see our compendium to try and figure out how to solve your issues.


## Question: Can I use my Steam Controller on a game console?

Answer: Most likely not. Because of the broad range of this question and the fact that we are unable to go in depth with this subject, it is heavily dependent on the system and whether or not some brave soul has managed to figure out a way to do it.

Keyboard and mouse translation might work in some scenarios but it isn't ideal. That said, there is a ton of emulation potential for the Steam Controller and I recommend looking at our guide to find out more


## Question: Can the Steam Deck run *(insert game here)*?

Answer: It's a PC, so yes. Valve is expecting to have the complete steam library compatible with Proton (the back end interpreter Valve is using to run Windows games on Linux) by launch.

Games outside of the Steam library will still be possible if you know your way around Linux with mostly fairly high compatibility.

If you do not like the compatibility that you find on Linux however you can install Windows and have about as much compatibility as you have now.


## Question: Can I use my Joy-Cons on Steam?

Answer: Not, at this point, no. While it appears it's been worked on at some point, Steam Input does not currently support Joy-Cons.

Instead we would recommend alternatives such as Joy-shock-mapper or reWASD. Both are fairly feature complete controller remapping software.


## Question: Why is the Steam Controller so expensive? Should I still buy one?

**Answer:** Much like any other device with a cult following, once the production ends there are still a ton of fanatical people who still want the hardware.

While nobody can know for sure, there's a good chance a new Steam Controller may be announced both for the Steam Deck and hardware that is currently only speculation.

Ultimately I won't give an answer, if you would like the opportunity to try out the steam controller you'll need to make that decision on your own. I won't lie, the hardware does have a significant learning curve, and for many a traditional controller that also has gyro may be a better fit.

However if you like the idea of being able to customize your controls from front to back, and are not turned off by the idea of needing to do that in most cases the Steam Controller just might be right for you.


## Question: I really want to buy one now. What should I be expected to pay?

**Answer:** This is of course a very subjective question but I'm going to do my best to give you the absolute maximum I would recommend paying.

First of all it is important to remember this is from the lens of someone living in North America, every single region will be different and due to the fact that North America is the single region to get the most stock provided the Steam Controller will understandably cost less here and be more abundant.

Those living in other regions may have to expect to pay more, and possibly even expect higher shipping. I hope the Steam Controller 2.0 will happen and can hopefully rectify this.


### For Used Average Condition 

Controllers that may not include a box or missing certain accessories, it becomes a little mixed as to how to put a price recommendation on them.

More often than not it may vary between cities and locations, but generally if you're buying something on eBay without accounting for shipping I would probably expect to pay $20 - $45 USD.

The most important accessory to note when looking for controllers that may be missing parts are the back plate and the custom 2.4 Ghz receiver.

Although the controller can be used in wired mode or replaced with the Bluetooth module after a firmware update, the official adapter is the preferable way and will lead to less l potential interference issues then Bluetooth.

The back plate however can be 3D printed, and technically speaking isn't a requirement for using the controller, but it's also not recommended to use one without it.


### For Used Complete In-Box Controllers in Great Condition 
The maximum I would recommend is paying $50 USD. 

It's important to know none of the accessories packaged with the steam controller are specifically necessary with perhaps the exception of a battery cover. However it's still generally recommended if you have the option, to pick up a unit that is complete with all of its original accessories.


### For Complete “Factory Sealed” Controllers
As of September 2021, the maximum price range I would recommend paying is $70 - $80 USD.

It's important to note that for boxes  sealed at the factory and shipped, the only indication on whether or not they have been opened is whether the two clear stickers applied to the back of the box have been cut or removed. 

At least in the North American region Valve did not take any special care in ceiling boxes with cellophane, they were simply packaged as is and shipped to the consumer.

As for boxes sold in retail stores, although I have only the experience of buying one from GameStop, it seems as though it was handled much the same. The only difference being often in retail stores Steam Controllers were instead kept in the back and the only units on display were cardboard boxes.

## Question: Do you have any information on a Steam Controller 2.0?

**Answer:** Other than speculation and patents, no. 

To see said speculation and patents, take a look at chapter 11: The Future of the Steam Controller.
