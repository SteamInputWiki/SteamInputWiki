# Chapter 03a: Anatomy of the Bindings Page

Mennenths notes not to be included in final wiki: screenshots will be taken for visual aid.

When selecting a Button you wish to assign a binding to, you are taken to the Bindings page.

At the very top, as with all pages, is the name of the configuration. Directly underneath that is the author of the configuration.

In the upper middle of the screen is a picture of the controller you are currently using.

In the lower middle of the screen is the box containing all the Bindings.

The first thing highlighted is a text entry field. This allows you to name your binding.

To the right of the text entry field is a row of bindings that interact with Steam, Steam Input, the controller, or your pc system.

Underneath the text entry and system bindings is the area you will find the bindings for actually playing the game; Mouse Buttons, Keyboard Buttons, and Gamepad Buttons. More on those in the next part of this chapter. 

At the very bottom of the page, as with all pages, are the keybindings and ui buttons for interacting with elements on the page.

* Listen for Key
  * This puts Steam Input into a “listen mode”. Instead of navigating to and selecting a binding, you can instead press the button on your mouse, keyboard, or gamepad to bind it directly.
* Remove
  * This removes the binding
* Toggle Multi-Button On
  * This allows you to bind multiple buttons. This enables you to activate a combination with a single press. A couple of examples may be ctrl+c and ctrl+v to make copy and paste easy in the desktop configuration
* Show Activators
  * This takes you to the Activators page if you want more in depth control over how your Button works. Activators will be covered in chapter 04.
