# Chapter 03: Intro to Buttons and Bindings

## Introduction

A Button is a simple binary “on or off” input device; you press it, which tells whatever it is you are trying to control what to do.

In the age of touch pads, touch screens, on screen menus, etc, Buttons can also be Virtual; consider a region on the Touchpad being designated as a Button. It works as a Button but is not physical in the same way; you “touch” that region as opposed to “pressing” the Button.

A Binding is the action that happens when the Button it is assigned to is pressed.

## What Physical Buttons Can Have Bindings Assigned to Them?

These are the Physical Buttons you will likely be familiar with, some found on controllers dating back all the way to the beginning of gaming though some are modern additions.

* The individual A, B, X, Y (or Sony equivalent) Buttons/ Binding locations found in the Button Pad Input Style
* The individual D-Pad directions. Binding locations found in the Directional Pad Input Style
* Right/Left Stick Click, found as “Click Action” in their respective Input Styles
* Right/Left Touchpad Click (steam controller touchpads), found as “Click Action” in their respective Input Styles
* Right/Left/Solo Touchpad Click (Sony touchpads), found as “Click Action” in their respective Input Styles
* Start/Forward/+
* Select/Back/-
* Star (Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers)
* Right/Left Bumper
* Right/Left Trigger Full Pull - for controllers that have digital only triggers, or for at the end of an analog triggers pull range
* Mic Mute (Sony Dualsense)
* Left and Right grip Buttons (Steam Controller)
* Paddles 1-4 of Xbox Elite series 2 controllers with Extended Support turned on and a blank profile loaded on the controller itself

NOTE: You cannot rebind the Guide/Home/System button on the controller, as Steam reserves that to access Steam functions or the Guide Chord Config.

## What Virtual Buttons Can Have Bindings Assigned to Them?

These are not traditional physical buttons, but rather “software events” that can be used to trigger Bindings. For example; when using a Touchpad in Steam Input, the simple act of touching the pad can be used as a Virtual Button to activate a Binding.

* Virtual A, B, X, Y (or Sony equivalent), when the “Button Pad” Input Style is applied to an input device not traditionally associated with ABXY such as Touchpads or Joysticks.
* Virtual D-Pad directions, when the “Directional Pad” Input Style is applied to an input device not traditionally associated with ABXY such as Touchpads or Joysticks.
  * Also utilized in the Directional Swipe Input Style
* The “Touch Binding”, often found in Input Styles when applied to a Touchpad.
  * Renamed “Trackpad Touch” in the Single Button Input Style
* The “Double Tap Binding”, often found in Input Styles when applied to a Touchpad.
* The “Outer Ring Binding”, found in several Input Styles that can be applied to XY coordinate Input Devices
* Touch Menu Button 1-16, found in the “Touch Menu” Input Style
  * Also found in the Hotbar Menu Input Style
* Radial Menu Button 1-20, found in the “Radial Menu” Input Style
* The “Center/Unselected Button”, found in the “Radial Menu” Input Style
* The “Scroll Forward/Backward Binding”, found in the Scroll Wheel Input Style
* Scroll Wheel List options 1-10, found in the Scroll Wheel Input Style
* “Gyro Lean Left/Right Binding”, available only to the Gyro Input Device
* “Always On Binding”, appears on the configuration overview page as an Infinity Sign above the left most Input Device
* Right/Left Trigger Soft Pull - for controllers that have analog triggers. This uses a user defined threshold that when the trigger is pulled beyond acts as a logical click.
* Force Sensing Resistor - This is a physical device but does not provide a physical click. It instead uses a pressure level threshold - set by the user - to act as a logical click.

## What Bindings can be assigned to Buttons?

There are 4 types of Bindings:

* Mouse Buttons
* Keyboard Buttons
* Gamepad Buttons
* SIAPI In-Game Actions

These will be discussed in more depth a little later on in this chapter.
