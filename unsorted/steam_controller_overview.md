# Steam Controller


## Function buttons


### Guide button

The guide button is round with shiny black plastic. The button features the Steam logo with and is slightly translucent. Behind it shines a white LED which once the controller is turned on can be seen illuminating the Steam logo.

The guide button is one of the few inputs that cannot be mapped on any controller. Instead the guide button can be used for corded mappings which allow you to at any point in time use these mappings with different physical inputs on the controller well ignoring any inputs that were previously bound.

### Forward Button

The forward button is round and oblong, with black shiny plastic featuring a dull gray slightly indented forward pointing arrow.

While the player can bind this button to any desired input, it's often recommended to bind this to either escape or an emulated start button as this is where many people's muscle memory would expect.

### Back button

The back button is round and oblong, with black shiny plastic featuring a dull gray slightly indented back facing arrow.

The back button is often bound to either an emulated select or tab button. Often however, The player can get away with binding this to whatever they desire and in many situations there may not be an intended binding for this spot.

## Face buttons

Much like most modern traditional controllers the Steam Controller features four face buttons. The face buttons may either be rebound or mapped to emulated XInput bindings.

Each are round, smaller than the typical controller and are black shiny plastic with each symbol slightly indented and painted in its represented color.

Here are the following buttons featured:

A Button

B Button

X Button

Y Button

The face buttons symbols on Steam Hardware are borrowed from Xbox controllers mostly due to the prevalence of XInput in legacy titles.


## Grip buttons

The Grip Buttons are officially named as followed:

Left Grip

Right Grip

The Grip buttons are intended to be blank slates for the player to add in whichever type of button input they would like. Any type of bindings the player would like can be applied to the grip buttons much like any other input source including layer activators.

The Grips are integrated into the battery door which is a slightly flexible piece of black plastic imprinted with the same texture as the body of the controller. Each group is slightly raised from the rest of the door and is designed to easily contour to the player's fingers that are left on the back of the controller.


## Shoulder Buttons

Bumpers ( or shoulder buttons ) are digital inputs that are at the very top of the controller. When the controller is held with two fingers at the top, the bumpers are nicely cradled by your index fingers.

The Steam Controller features both a Left and Right Bumper.

Players may find the bumpers to require an unreasonable amount of force in order to actuate, therefore it's recommendable to use less common actions here.

## Analog Inputs
## Triggers

Much like any traditional controller, The steam controller features both a Left and Right Trigger. Each trigger is contoured for easy leverage and control with the player's finger.

Each trigger is made with black plastic and features a similar texture to that of the body of the controller.

The Steam Controller has Dual-Stage Analog Triggers, meaning that it has the average analog range of more modern traditional controllers with a tactile digital click at the end of the trigger's compression. Players often use triggers mapped to their corresponding XInput analog values and an optional extra button press at the end; mostly used for secondary actions such as reload.

### Analog stick

Unlike most modern controllers the Steam Controller only features a single analog stick. The analog stick was added later on in the development of the controller assumingly in order to aid players who are already comfortable with use of traditional controllers.

Much like any other analog stick, the one included on Steam Controllers feature two axes of analog movement and allows for the user to click in and has an extra digital input.

### Touchpads

The touchpads on the Steam Controller are fairly reminiscent of touchpads available on many modern laptops.

 The touch pads are circular featuring black plastic covers with an anti-grip texture. The touch pads are not flat like most pads, they're designed with a slight curvature aided by the grips of the controller. Everything is designed specifically to encourage users to hold their thumbs at more ideal angles when using the touchpads.

The player ultimately has full control over how they use the touchpads for input, as they allow for most styles of input to be applied.

#### Left touchpad

Well both touch pads are matte black fairly smooth yet noisy texture, the left pad specifically has an indented plus. 

Well The intention after launch by Valve was to use the left touch pad for d-pad-based actions, many within the same controller community have found preference for using the left pad for analog character movement, rather than using the analog stick.

#### Right touchpad

While often the right touchpad is bound as camera movement, the player ultimately has as much freedom as they wish to experiment. Because of the inclusion of the gyro 

### Gyroscope

Although the gyroscopic hardware in the Steam Controller is capable of six axes of motion, steam input only allows for the tracking and configuring of three axes of motion (pitch, yaw and roll).

Gyroscopes are designed to track and trace the controllers real-time movement in the physical world. With the Steam Input we can use the gyroscope to map many different analog inputs.

Often the recommended use for the gyroscope is to bind mouse movement whenever possible. Many use this in combination with the Right Touchpad bound as mouse, and while it may seem counterintuitive both of these input methods often work well together for First Person Shooters as well as many other Genres.
