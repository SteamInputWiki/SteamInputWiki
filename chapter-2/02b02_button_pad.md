# 02b02: Button Pad

Recommended Watching: Link to Critical Composers video

This Input Style acts as a face button set or diamond of 4 buttons, much like how modern controllers have ABXY for Xbox controllers, BAYX for Nintendo controllers, and Cross-Circle-Square-Traingle for Sony controllers. As such, it works how you would expect those to work. It gives you 4 binding slots, 1 for each button.

This Input Style can be assigned to:

* actual Face Button Sets
* D-Pads
* Touchpads
* Joysticks

When assigned to an Actual Face Button set, it works exactly like you would expect the Face Button set to work.

When assigned to a D-pad, it functions more or less the same as on an Actual Face Button set only with the physical limitations of a D-pad (no simultaneous opposing cardinal directions possible, so no X+B or A+Y or 3 or 4 button combos possible).

When assigned to xy coordinate devices such as Touchpads and Joysticks, it creates 4 zones in the xy coordinates that match where the bindings would be and activate when the device is outputting those coordinates. SOCD is impossible, and depending on settings even A+B, B+Y, A+X, and X+Y button combos are impossible.

For Actual Face Button sets and D-Pads, the settings are extremely limited. You can change the Bindings and set up a Mode Shift, but that is it.

For xy coordinate devices, there are 3 other settings.

## Settings

### Bindings

The default bindings for this mode are the Xbox ABXY buttons, positioned where you would expect them to be. However, these bindings can be changed to whatever you would like for instance in the event of playing a keyboard and mouse only game.

### Mode Shifting

This allows you to set a button to modeshift the input device into an entirely different input style. Modeshfting is covered in more detail in chapter 4.

### Button Radius

This setting is only available to xy coordinate devices.

This slider determines how big the zones are for the Buttons.

### Button Distance

This setting is only available to xy coordinate devices.

This slider determines how much distance is in between the zones for the Buttons, as well as the center of the xy coordinates.

### Radius and Distance work together

By adjusting these sliders, you can configure the virtual Button Pad to either have no overlap between the buttons at all, or how much they overlap by.

### Requires Click

This setting is only available to xy coordinate devices.

This is a binary Off or On setting that determines if you need to click the device in order to send the Button.
