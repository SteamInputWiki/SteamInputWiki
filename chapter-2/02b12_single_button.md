02b12: Single Button

This Input Style is… a Single Button! It acts like a button. That is it. But it's the most advanced Single Button you’ll ever use!

This Input Style can be assigned to:

* Touchpads
  * Either the Steam Controller style primary touchpads
  * ds4/dualsense style aux touch pads, in single or split mode

When applied to Touchpads, it functions as a “digital dual stage” button allowing you to use it as a touch button or an actual click button or both at once. The entire surface of the touchpad becomes one giant button.

The settings for this Input Style are as follows:

* Trackpad Click
  * This is a location where you can bind an action.
  * It is activated by clicking the touchpad/trackpad
* Trackpad Touch
  * This is a location where you can bind an action.
  * It is activated simply by touching the touchpad/trackpad; no need to click
  * If you desire haptic feedback, this will have to be done on the Activator settings. Activators are covered in Chapter 04
* Mode Shifting
  * This will be covered in depth in Chapter 04

And that is really all there is to the Single Button Input Style. It's exceptionally straightforward.
