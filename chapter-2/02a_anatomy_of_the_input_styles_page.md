# 02a: Anatomy of the Input Styles Page

Mennenths notes not to be included in final wiki: screenshots will be taken for visual aid.

When selecting an input device that uses Styles and going into the settings, this is the page you will first encounter. This is the Input Styles Page.

At the very top, as with all pages, is the name of the configuration. Directly underneath that is the author of the configuration.

At the very bottom of the page, as with all pages, are the keybindings and ui buttons for interacting with elements on the page.

In the upper middle of the screen is the Description Box. This box updates with information as you highlight various elements on the screen. At the top of the box is the name of the highlighted element, and then in that box is a short description by Valve explaining that element.

In the lower middle of the screen is the Settings Box. This is where all of the settings are. It is divided into 3 columns of settings.

The Style of Input drop down will always be at the top of the left column. This is where you select which Input Style you’d like the device to use.

The Mode Shifting box will always be at the top of the right column. More on Mode Shifting in chapter 04.

Once you have selected an Input Style, the columns fill with all the settings related to that Input Style. For a detailed description of a particular Input Style, refer to its section in this chapter.

Some Input Styles are simple enough that all of their settings can fit on a single page. Other Input Styles may have even more settings. In those cases, an “Additional Settings” option will appear at the bottom of the right column. Selecting that option will take you to a second settings page.
