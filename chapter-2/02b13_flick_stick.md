# 02b13: Flick Stick

### What is Flick Stick?

Recommended watching: (insert Jibb Smarts video on it here)

NOTE: Despite having “Stick” in its name, because of how Flick Stick works the game sees Mouse input instead of Joystick input.

This Input Style is an innovative way to use the Right Joystick when Gyro is being used for aiming. As such, outside of niche circumstances Flick Stick should not be used unless Gyro is also being used (sorry xbox controller users).

This Input Style was originally developed by Jibb Smart and implemented in his own controller remapping software, JoyShockMapper. After seeing it’s popularity, Valve made their own implementation for Steam Input.

Flick Stick works differently than how most people would expect the Joystick to work. The closest analogy I can think of would be like twin stick shooter controls, only from the perspective of the character instead of the regular top down view of those games. So tilting the Joystick “down” causes the camera to immediately do a 180 degree “about face”, tilting it “left” or “right” results in an immediate 90 degree turn in their respective directions, and all degrees in between. But that is not all! Once the Joystick has been tilted and the Flick is complete, continuing to turn/spin/rotate the Joystick while tilted results in the camera smoothly turning in that direction by the same degree you are turning the Joystick.

Flick Stick basically grants you incredible speed and precision over the camera’s x/horizontal axis, however it sacrifices the y/vertical axis to do so which is why in most scenarios you will need to be using Gyro as well.

The best way to view this Input Style is that your Joystick is a “fast turn” input and your Gyro is your “aiming” input. You use the stick to quickly turn to where an enemy is, and then the gyro to aim at them more precisely.

### What Input Devices Can Flick Stick Be Applied To?

* Left/Right Joysticks
* Touchpads
* Face Button Cluster
* Directional Pad

NOTE: When applied to a Face Button Cluster or Directional Pad, only 90 and 180 degree Flicks will be possible and smoothly turning will not be possible.

## Flick Stick Settings

With the exception of one setting (which will be at the end of this list), all Input Devices share the same settings for this Input Style.

### Click Binding

This Binding uses the Joystick Click, Touchpad Click, or clicking any of the Face Buttons or Directions on the Directional Pad to activate a binding. A typical use for this Binding is the traditional Joystick Clicks; assigning right stick click to the Right Joystick and left to the left.

!! CAUTION !! As just mentioned, when this Style is being applied to a Face Button Set or D-Pad, any input will activate this Binding as all inputs with those Devices are clicks.

### Mouse Sensitivity

This slider adjusts how large the Mouse movement that gets sent to the game is. This is important for “calibrating” Flick Stick so that tilting the Joystick in a direction, like down, results in the desired outcome, like a 180 degree about face.

### Smoothing

This slider filters the input to prevent undesired camera noise or jitter. Higher values will result in more smoothing.

### Flick Duration

If you do not want the “instant 180 degree about face” to be so instant, maybe for motion sickness concerns, you can stretch the about face out over time to make the movement look more realistic. The higher the value, the longer it takes to complete a Flick.

### Mode Shifting

This allows you to set a button to Mode Shift the input device into an entirely different Input Style. Mode Shifting is covered in more detail in chapter 4.

### Outer Ring Binding

This Binding Activates whenever the user has tilted the virtual Joystick past a defined threshold.

!! CAUTION !! When this Style is being applied to a Face Button Set or D-Pad, any input will activate this Binding as all inputs with those Devices will be considered at the maximum value which will always be beyond the defined threshold.

### Joystick Flick Radius Threshold

This slider determines how far you have to tilt the virtual Joystick in order to initiate a Flick. Larger values mean you have to tilt the stick further to Flick.

### Rotation

This setting is only available to Touchpads and Joysticks.

This slider allows you to rotate the software grid of the virtual Joystick to better line up with your individual movements. You want to adjust this slider so a movement you think should be perfectly horizontal is horizontal only.
