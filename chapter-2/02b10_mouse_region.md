# 02b10 Mouse Region

This Input Style allows the user to map the entire surface of your Touchpad to a segment of your screen. By default your Mouse Cursor will snap back to center when lifting off the Pad as well as when becoming active on your configuration.

Mouse Region is most comparable in function to Touchscreens in terms of base function.

**_!! CAUTION !!_** Although this Input Style can be applied to Button based Input Sources, because they lack analog variables, the Mouse Cursor will only ever move to the maximum of their allowed directions.

Gyro sources also do not seem to function properly. Rather than functioning in a smaller more enclosed square in front of the user it requires the user to physically move the controller much farther than should ever be necessary.

## Region Size

Region Size controls the physical space that your Mouse Region will be mapped to.

Increasing the slider allows the Mouse Region to encompass more of the screen while decreasing forces it to encompass less of the screen.

## Click Binding

Click Bindings work mostly like they would with any other Input Styles, and truly only function properly on touch based Input and Joysticks.

The Click Binding is applied when the touch-based Input and Joysticks is physically depressed. For other non-touch based Inputs because the only way to utilize Mouse Region is to depress the buttons; it will be applied at all times while using Mouse Region.

## Touch Binding

Touch Bindings work just like they would with any other Input Styles, and truly only function properly on touch based Input.

The Binding is applied while physically touching the Input source, or for Input sources that don't have a way to read touch, it is applied when the Input source is used in any manner.

## Horizontal Position

The Horizontal Position slider controls the physical space the mouse region will encompass on the horizontal axis.

Moving the slider to the right will move the Mouse Region to more to the right of the screen while moving the slider to the left moves it to more of the left side of the screen.
