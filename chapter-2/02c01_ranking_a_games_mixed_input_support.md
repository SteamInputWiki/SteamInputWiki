# 02c01 Ranking a Games’ Mixed Input Support
### Disclaimer
This guide is not here to suggest games that do not support Mixed Input shouldn’t be purchased, while not supporting a feature you want is a valid thing to factor in when making said purchasing decisions, I'd like to stress this is not intended to suggest the quality of a game over all. Nor does a game not supporting Mixed Inputs mean it cannot be played with Steam Hardware or other Steam Input supported controllers.

What this guide is meant to do however, is teach it’s readers on the quality of Mixed Input support we expect from our user submitted games and to give us a baseline on how to rate a game.
