# 05: Where to Start With Building Your Own Configuration

At this point in the wiki you should have accomplished the following:

* Hooked up your controller to your pc
* Enabled support for it in Steam
* Changed some general controller settings to personalize your controller a bit in Steam
* Learned what types of configurations Steam has and where to find them
* Gained a cursory understanding of the following (or at the very least, the first two):
  * Input Styles
  * Bindings
  * Activators
  * Modeshifts
  * Sets
  * Layers

You may now want to try your hand at making a configuration for the game that you are playing, but are still unsure of where to begin or how to go about it successfully. It is afterall a LOT of information to take in.

It is not hard, but it does take some time. A common complaint especially in regards to the Steam Controller is that you will be spending hours upon hours in the configurator and not really playing the game. This is only partially true; as with any program on your computer, the more you use it the more efficient you get at using it. 

Once you’ve developed your own configuration style and know what you are looking for when it comes to the game you are playing, you shouldn't be spending hours and hours per game; I rarely spend more than about 5 minutes in the configurator per game at this point (often as little as 30-45 seconds for genres where I already have a personalized template developed for), unless I’m trying to do something really novel or the game provides a unique problem to solve.

But until you get to that point, this Chapter will help ease you into the process.

Section A of this Chapter will talk about good places to start with:

* Templates
* Developer Defaults
* Community Configs

Sections B and onward of this Chapter will provide tips and tricks to refine your configuration or do unique things within it, but it is important to note that they are not exhaustive or authoritative.

These tips and tricks have been developed by members of the Steam Input community. Some of them you may find helpful, others you may never use. As alluded to a bit earlier, as you gain knowledge on and experience in the configurator you’ll likely develop your own configuration style with your own tricks. Feel free to contact the Steam Input Wiki team if you’ve done something unique and want to share it with the community via this wiki! I learned from someone, developed my own trick, put it out there, then someone else built on it in a way I did not expect. The morale of that story? The more tips and tricks that exist, the better.

With that said, on to Section A.
