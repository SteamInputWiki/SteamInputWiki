# 05a03: Community Configurations

In a nutshell, Community Configurations are configurations that other users have made and have exported to Steam for others to use.

## Importing a Community Configuration

You can find these configurations by clicking on “Browse Configs” at the bottom of the Configuration Overview page. This takes you to the “Controller Configurations - Import” page. Then navigate to the “Community” category in the list on the left hand side of the screen.

Every configuration in that view has been uploaded by another player. They are sorted by total combined playtime of everyone using that specific configuration.

Community configurations also have an upvote system that people can use to endorse a configuration beyond the playtime.

NOTE: This category will only show Community Configurations for that game, AND for the controller you are using. You can view configurations for other controller types (by using the “show other controller types” button at the bottom of the screen) and can even import configurations cross controller device type. Steam will try to convert the configuration from one device to another, however you may need to make some adjustments after the fact.

Unfortunately, as Community Configurations are sorted by total combined playtime you can’t be guaranteed that the top configurations are the best for that game. A lot of people will simply be the “first out of the gate” by uploading a barely modified Template configuration. You may have to do a bit of digging to find a truly good Community Configuration. If you do, by all means upvote it! While it does not seem to have a large impact, the Valve devs have told the Steam Controller discord that there is a bit of a revolving door mechanic to try and make sure good configurations rise to the top and upvoting counts!

Using a Community Configuration also does not mean you will not need to do any tweaking at all. A lot of settings tend to be pretty personal (such as Rotation for the Mouse Input Style). However, this only means a good Community Configuration can be an amazing jumping off point towards building your own configuration. You can start off only needing to make minor changes at first, and eventually work your way towards a full configuration build.

## Exporting Your Own Configuration to the Community

Once you have built a configuration you are happy with, you can export it to the community category for others to see.

You do this by pressing the “Export Config” button at the bottom of the Configuration Overview page, which takes you to the “Controller Configurations - Export” page. Navigate to the Community category in the list on the left hand side of the page, and you can publish the configuration with (top option). You’ll be able to name it and give it a brief description.

Once you have done so, congratulations! You have made and exported a configuration. I hope it does well!

NOTE: You must play with your configuration for at least 5 minutes before you can publish it. And Valve seemingly does have a way to track if you are actively making inputs or just idling, so actually do play for a bit. It's beneficial anyway, to make sure the configuration works.

Instead of waiting for people to find your configuration, you can also get a direct link to your configuration by clicking on the “share configuration” button at the bottom of the screen. This copies a link to your configuration into your clipboard. You can then paste this anywhere to advertise your configuration to others. It will look something like this: steam://controllerconfig/996580/2627411413 (this is a link to my Spyro Reignited Trilogy configuration). If you see a link like that and want to check out what that person has done in their configuration, just copy and paste the link into a web browser while Steam is running.
