# Chapter 05f: Accommodating Accessibility in Input as a Developer

The following guide is not meant to shame developers that have not previously considered or have been unable to cater to many different accessibility options. We understand that sometimes these different features may be at odds with either your budget, work capacity, or even your ultimate vision for your project. We simply love gaming and want to share the medium with as many people as possible while fostering a more loving community.

We'd like to take this moment to remind developers optimizing for Steam Input should not be relied on for its accessibility functionality. As will be discussed later in [Chapter 06b01](https://github.com/SteamInputWiki/SteamInputWiki/blob/main/chapter-6/06b01_deciding_if_steam_input_is_right_for_your_project.md), we should never be making assumptions about how our player will be interacting with our game based on input sources and hardware design characteristics. We should be allowing the player to have the ability to override any of these design decisions.

Also worth mentioning fundamental features such as game remapping, dead zone tweaks, and other accessibility-based changes to input should never be left up to other input remapping software. Although we recommend having these features optimized for remapping software, these features should be built directly into your game to provide ease of access regardless of what software your players have installed or platform purchased from.
