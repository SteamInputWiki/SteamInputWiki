## Chapter 08b: Steam Hardware Based Steam Curators

Here is a list of Steam community run Curators we feel may be beneficial for consumers when buying to use with Steam Hardware.

* [SCAPI Games](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30072643/) **(Active)** A curator group on Steam focused on reviewing games from the perspective of how they work with Steam Input, basic configuration OR SIAPI implementation. “SCAPI” instead of “SIAPI” is due to age.
* [SC Optimized](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11109760-SC-Optimized/) **(Inactive)** Denotes games that have Native Steam Input support as well as Mixed Input compatibility while providing little else in way of information. The last review was posted on **February 26, 2016** and therefore only included for archival purposes.
* [Games for SC Beginners](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30069499-Games-for-SC-Beginners/) **(Inactive)** A short list of games recommended for new Steam Controller users. While a good place to start for recommendations it also suggests games that do not have either Native support or support for Mixed Input and may not play as well as a result. The last review was posted on **October 8, 2017** and therefore only included for archival purposes.
* [Trackpad Controller Gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11165520-Trackpad-Controller-Gaming/) **(Inactive)** A short list of games that work well on Steam Controller. One of the first Steam Controller based curators, however recommendations not made based on supported Input methods. The last review was posted on **December 14, 2015** and therefore only included for archival purposes.

## Chapter 08f: Steam Controller Accessories

This section covers accessories that were made for the Steam Controller.

### First Party

Due to the Steam Controllers discontinuation, these are also no longer made and are on this list for more archival reasons.

* Valves Steam Controller Carrying Case
* Valves Steam Controller Dongle Holder Battery Door
* Valves decals

### Third Party

Some of these may or may not be still in production given the Steam Controllers Discontinuation.

* Foamy Lizard: rubber cover/skin for the controller
* Decalgirl: not specific to the Steam Controller, but makes decals for a variety of electronics including the Steam Controller
* TouchProtects by Colored Controllers: Circles cut from a variety of 3m vinyl to customize the color or texture (or both) of the touchpads, to protect them from wear
* 3daptive Joystick Attachment: a 3d printed attachment that uses a spiral spring with a conductive puck in the middle to make the Right Touchpad feel more like a joystick for joystick modes

### Good Ideas

These are not officially targeted for use with the Steam Controller, but can be used and enhance the experience.

* Thumb Socks (no particular brand): designed primarily for mobile gaming, these conductive socks for your thumbs also work really well on the Steam Controllers Touchpads to reduce friction. Combine with Satin TouchProtects for an incredibly smooth experience
  * Mennenth's Recommendation: Tipkits brand, can be purchased on amazon. They are more expensive per sock than some of the "pack of 20 for 5 dollars" no name brands you can also find on amazon, though having used both I can say the price difference is reflected in the quality. The cheaper per sock versions are less densley stitched with openings that are not actually finished, leading them to wear out curl up and fall off your thumb.
* 2 pairs of Rechargeable AA's with a charging cradle (no particular brand): can last for years, reducing the total number of batteries you buy significnatly

### Mods

Debating about if this should even be included.
