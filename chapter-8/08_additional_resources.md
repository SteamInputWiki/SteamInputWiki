## Chapter 08b: Steam Hardware Based Steam Curators

* [SCAPI Games](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30072643/) **(Active)** A curator group on Steam focused on reviewing games from the perspective of how they work with Steam Input, basic configuration OR SIAPI implementation. “SCAPI” instead of “SIAPI” is due to age.
* [SC Optimized](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11109760-SC-Optimized/) **(Inactive)** Denotes games that have Native Steam Input support as well as Mixed Input compatibility while providing little else in way of information. The last review was posted on **February 26, 2016** and therefore only included for archival purposes.
* [Games for SC Beginners](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30069499-Games-for-SC-Beginners/) **(Inactive)** A short list of games recommended for new Steam Controller users. While a good place to start for recommendations it also suggests games that do not have either Native support or support for Mixed Input and may not play as well as a result. The last review was posted on **October 8, 2017** and therefore only included for archival purposes.
* [Trackpad Controller Gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11165520-Trackpad-Controller-Gaming/) **(Inactive)** A short list of games that work well on Steam Controller. One of the first Steam Controller based curators, however recommendations not made based on supported Input methods. The last review was posted on **December 14, 2015** and therefore only included for archival purposes.
